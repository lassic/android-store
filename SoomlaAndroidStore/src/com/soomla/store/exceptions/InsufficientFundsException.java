/**
 * When a user tries to perform an action for which he does not have enough funds, an
 * InsufficientFundsException is thrown.
 *
 * Real Game Example:
 *  Example Inventory: { currency_coin: 100, green_hat: 3, blue_hat: 5 }
 *  Say a blue_hat costs 200 currency_coin.
 *  Suppose that you have a user that wants to buy a blue_hat.
 *  You'll probably call StoreInventory.buy("blue_hat").
 *  InsufficientFundsException will be thrown with "blue_hat" as the itemId.
 *  You can just catch this exception in order to notify the user that he doesn't have enough
 *  coins to buy a blue_hat.
